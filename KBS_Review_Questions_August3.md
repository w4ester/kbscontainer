# CyberUXcellence Awards - Site Review Questions for KBS
## August 3, 2025

Dear KBS Team,

Please find below our section-by-section review questions for the August 6 winners reveal version of the CyberUXcellence Awards website. Each section includes specific questions that need your input.

---

## NAVIGATION SECTION

**(Question KBS)** Should we rename "Winners" to "Awards" in the navbar? This would make it more evergreen and align with the section naming.

## HERO SECTION

- No questions for this section

## WINNERS SECTION

**(Question KBS #1)** Section naming: Should we keep it as "Winners" or change to "Awards"? Currently shows "Award Winners" as the section title.

**(Question KBS #2)** Logo colors: Should we change the company logos to their real brand colors instead of the white filter? Currently all logos are white for consistency on the gradient background.

**(Question KBS #3)** Nominate button placement: Should we include a "Nominate for 2026" button in the Winners section, or keep it only in the Why Nominate section? This would be the HubSpot form button.

**Note:** We've removed the "View All Winners & Finalists" button as discussed. For 2026, we could consider showing finalists leading up to the event.
